    <h1>Instagram, Envy and Consumerism</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p> ocial media has grown exponentially in the last few years, and due to its rise, advertising has shifted. Influencers are now one of the best ways for brands to push products. The impact of the influencer economy seems to be aimed at teen girls and young women who use social media frequently. How has the shift in advertising impacted consumerism? DoInstagram ads and fashion content on social media cause consumers to make purchases they otherwise wouldnâ€™t have? The area under study would be the intersection of media and psychology. In the same way that parasocial relationships can be built through social media, envy can be built through comparison to influencers that are viewed as peers with an attainable lifestyle.
