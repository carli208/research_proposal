\n This article details the rise of social media in recent years. There has been a 357% increase in users from 2014 to 2017 on Instagram. The number of advertisers on Instagram doubled in march 2017, and 72% of users report making “purchase decisions based on something they saw while browsing the app.” Instagram and its parent company Facebook hold the top spots for their influence on shopping habits. They also give people platforms to observe their peers' shopping habits, which can also influence purchase decisions. What this study lacks is looking at specific varieties of products (i.e. fashion) and specific groups of people. Although it does note that peers’ shopping habits can influence consumers, it leaves out the concept of this being driven by envy. Additionally, even though the rise of social media is discussed, there is no display of how peoples’ interactions with social media and the influencer economy have changed.

\n The idea that social media drives consumerism is based on the concept of envy. As traditional advertising has lost its draw due to the rise of social media, people are starting to move away from traditional celebrity endorsements and towards their peers and ‘influencers’ that seem to have an attainable lifestyle. Due to the access that people now have to their peer’s lives, comparison is now on a more extreme scale. It's easier to see the lifestyles of those closer in class/situation as more attainable, and therefore desire them more. This combination has driven feelings of envy up.

\n Influencers are a tool for brands to engage consumers on social media. Fast fashion brands have also turned to their own social media as a new way to advertise. For example, Fashion Nova publishes 600-900 new pieces per week, and pots on social media 48 times per day. This article also details the shift from celebrity to influencers. “The public prefers someone who is a bit more relatable” over a traditional celebrity.  Because we have more access to other people’s lives, our social circles are artificially inflated. This increases FOMO (the fear of missing out). In order to keep up with the highly curated lives of our peers on social media, consumers may make purchases to emulate their lives.
