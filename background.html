    <p> Smith, Melissa. “The Eye-Opening Influence of Instagram on Buying [Infographic].” Impact, 6 Sept. 2020, impactplus.com/blog/influence-of-instagram-on-buying-infographic .

This article details the rise of social media in recent years. There has been a 357% increase in users from 2014 to 2017 on Instagram. The number of advertisers on Instagram doubled in march 2017, and 72% of users report making “purchase decisions based on something they saw while browsing the app.” Instagram and its parent company Facebook hold the top spots for their influence on shopping habits. They also give people platforms to observe their peers' shopping habits, which can also influence purchase decisions. What this study lacks is looking at specific varieties of products (i.e. fashion) and specific groups of people. Although it does note that peers’ shopping habits can influence consumers, it leaves out the concept of this being driven by envy. Additionally, even though the rise of social media is discussed, there is no display of how peoples’ interactions with social media and the influencer economy have changed.
