      <p> Method-
Participants - I want to look at teen/early twenties women that use social media regularly. The marketing of fashion and in general the influencer economy is more targeted towards women than men. I also think people who have spent more of their lives around social media give a better idea on the effect it has on someone so younger people would be better.
I will probably exclude men, as the impact of social media on women, specifically teen girls, has been more studied and gives me a better base for research.  As a very broad characterization, women also tend to be more invested in fashion, or in the influencer sphere as a whole
Of the Creswell Qualitative Approaches, the most applicable to me would be Phenomenological - look at the lived experiences of a phenomenon of several people
My phenomenon seems more complex than those described in the reading
normally it is done with interviews, sometimes multiple with each participant
Participants must be carefully selected
This would be the best approach for my purposes because I want to characterize a trend/phenomenon that affects multiple people, theories already exist about the phenomenon,  and the participants may have little to nothing in common.
