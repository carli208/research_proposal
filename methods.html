        <strong> Participants </strong> <br>I want to look at teen/early twenties women that use social media regularly. The marketing of fashion and in general the influencer economy is more targeted towards women than men. I also think people who have spent more of their lives around social media give a better idea on the effect it has on someone so younger people would be better.
I will probably exclude men, as the impact of social media on women, specifically teen girls, has been more studied and gives me a better base for research.  As a very broad characterization, women also tend to be more invested in fashion, or in the influencer sphere as a whole
        <br> </br> <strong> Qualitative Approaches </strong> <br>Of the Creswell Qualitative Approaches, the most applicable to me would be Phenomenological which looks at the lived experiences of a phenomenon of several people.
My phenomenon seems more complex than those described in the reading
Usually it is done with interview(s) with each participants. Because this approach relies so heavily on it's participants, they must be carefully selected.
This would be the best approach for my purposes because I want to characterize a trend/phenomenon that affects multiple people, theories already exist about the phenomenon,  and the participants may have little to nothing in common. </br>
  <br> <strong> Design </strong> <br> I see this study being conducted mainly through interviews. After identifying participants, they  will be interviewed about their experiences using social media, and their purchasing history and how those relate. Questions may also delve into the impact of social media on their mental health. I also like the idea of presenting participants with sample posts and  seeing how they react to them, and what they analyze from the images. Additionally, looking at some sample media from the participants' own social media feed as well as who they are following could help illustrate the trend.
  <br></br><strong> Analysis </strong> <br> I would likely use inductive coding to analyze the results, I think top-down coding may lead to assumptions being made rather than making theories from the data itself. Results that show no link between social media and emotions such as envy would disprove my hypothesis, as would results that show no connection between envy and making purchases However, results that show both a link between social media and negative emotions and a link between negative emotions and consumerism would confirm my hypothesis. If there is a trend in participants of recognizing negative emotions correlated with their social media use and recognizing social mediaâ€™s power in their purchasing decisions then my hypothesis is proven.
<br></br> <strong> Gaps in Avaliable Research </strong> </br> Most of the studies I looked at either discussed consumerism on social media or envy caused by social media. Not many studies that I was able to find were about finding a strong link between those two concepts. A lot of studies were also missing specifics and discussed general trends, but not details of posts or of the people experiencing these trends. With this study, I would provide both a connection between envy and consumerism, and personal stories of participants.
